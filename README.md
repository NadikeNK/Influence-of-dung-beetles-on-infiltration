# Influence-of-dung-beetles-on-infiltration


Explanation of datafiles and folders

- INF_DB:
Infiltration capacity (Ksat) for each mesocosm with different treatments (soil-only, dung-only, dung-beetles) and time steps (prior, day 1, day 5, day 10)

- BlueDye_percentage_10mm
Percentage of blue-stained pixels per mesocosm, averaged over 10 mm soil depth

- BlueDye_porewidth_10mm
Number of pores belonging to the three pore-width categories (0-20 mm, 20 - 200 mm, 200 - 1000 mm) per mesocosm, averaged over 10 mm soil depth

 - BlueDye_Photos
Raw photos of blue dye treated soil pits for each mesocosm (before georectifying). The name of each jpg file gives the individual mesocosm (e.g. 1C), and the applied treatment (SO = soil-only, DB = dung-beetles), as well as time step (day1 = day 1, day5 = day 5)

- BlueDye_Matrices
Matrices of blue dye pattern for each mesocosm (after georectifying and color-coding). Each cell in the matrix represents one mm^2, the cell-values stand for if blue dye was detected (1) or not (0).
